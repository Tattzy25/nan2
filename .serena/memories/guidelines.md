# Guidelines

- Always launch Serena with context `ide-assistant` and follow the steps in `agent-serena.md`.
- Remember Tavily is available and should be used when external research is needed.
- Context7 sequential thinking tools are active; lean on them before reading large files.
- Memory is critical: check existing memories before asking to regenerate context, and add updates via `write_memory` when project workflows change.
- If additional tools are required, ask the user so they can install and expose them.
